A command-line application that will automatically synchronize recommended settings from TRaSH
guides to your Sonarr/Radarr instances.

Formerly named "Trash Updater".

## Sonarr Features

### Release Profiles

- "Preferred", "Must Not Contain", and "Must Contain" terms from guides are reflected in
  corresponding release profile fields in Sonarr.
- "Include Preferred when Renaming" is properly checked/unchecked depending on explicit mention of
  this in the guides.
- Profiles get created if they do not exist, or updated if they already exist. Profiles get a unique
  name based on the guide and this name is used to find them in subsequent runs.
- Tags can be added to any updated or created profiles. Tags are created for you if they do not
  exist.
- Ability to convert preferred with negative scores to "Must not contain" terms.
- Terms mentioned as "optional" in the guide can be selectively included or excluded; based entirely
  on user preference.
- Convenient command line options to get information from the guide to more easily add it to your
  YAML configuration.

### Quality Definitions

- Anime and Series (Non-Anime) quality definitions from the guide.
- "Hybrid" type supported that is a mixture of both.

## Radarr Features

### Quality Definitions

- Movie quality definition from the guide

### Custom Formats

- A user-specified list of custom formats are synchronized to Radarr from the TRaSH guides.
- Scores from the guides can be synchronized to quality profiles of your choosing.
- User can specify their own scores for custom formats (instead of using the guide score).
- Option to enable automatic deletion custom formats in Radarr when they are removed from config or
  the guide.

## Requirements

Before installing & running Recyclarr, please review the requirements below.

- Minimum Supported Sonarr Version: `3.0.4.1098`
- Minimum Supported Radarr Version: `3.*`
- OpenSSL 1.x required on Linux

## Installation

Simply download the latest release for your platform using the table below. The download itself is
just a ZIP file with a single executable in it. You can put this executable anywhere you want and
run it.

release notes and older releases.

### Important Notices

- For Sonarr support to work, you must be running version `3.0.4.1098` or greater.
- Do not run Notifiarr's Trash Guides Integration in conjunction with Recyclarr's Custom Format
  synchronization. In general, you should not have two different tools updating the same data in
  Radarr.

### Special Note about Linux

When you extract the ZIP archive on Linux, it will *not* have the executable permission set. After
you've downloaded and extracted the executable, you can use the command below to make it executable.

```bash
chmod u+rx recyclarr
```

*Note: There used to be a convenient one-liner available here, but that was removed with the
introduction of multiple architecture support. That one liner was no longer sufficient and a more
complex solution was needed to determine which architecture to download for. But if you're using
linux, I think you can handle what needs to be done :-)*

## Getting Started

Recyclarr requires a YAML configuration file in order to work. Run the steps below if you want to
get started with a minimal configuration file.

- Run `recyclarr create-config` to create a starter `recyclarr.yml` file in the same directory as the
  executable. You can also use `--path` to customize the filename and location.
- Open the generated YAML file from the previous step. At a minimum you must update the `base_url`
  and `api_key` settings for each service that you want to use. Change/delete other parts of the
  file as you see fit.
- Run `recyclarr sonarr` and/or `recyclarr radarr` as needed to update those instances.

The last step above will do a "basic" sync from the guides to Sonarr and/or Radarr. The starter YAML
config is very minimal. See the next section for further reading and links to the wiki for
additional topics and more advanced customization.

Lastly, each subcommand supports printing help on the command line. Simply run `recyclarr --help` for
the main help output and a list of subcommands. You can then see the help for each subcommand by
running `recyclarr [subcommand] --help`, where `[subcommand]` is one of those subcommands (e.g.
`sonarr`)

## Important Notices

The script may stop working at any time due to guide updates. I will do my best to fix them in a
timely manner. Reporting such issues ASAP would be appreciated and will help identify issues more
quickly.
